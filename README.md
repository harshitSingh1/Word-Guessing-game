# 🔐 Guess the 7-Letter Password Game

Welcome to a terminal-based word guessing game! In this fun and engaging Python project, your goal is to **guess a secret 7-letter password** randomly chosen from a list of words. The game provides color-coded feedback to help you figure out the password in **5 attempts**.
